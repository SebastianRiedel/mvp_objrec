  <param name="pair_width" value="35.0"/>
  <!-- Pair width should be roughly half the extent of the visible object
       part. This means, for each object point p there should be (at least) one
       point q (from the same object) such that ||p - q|| <= 'pairwidth'.
       TRADEOFF: Smaller values allow for detection in occluded scenes but lead
       to more imprecise alignment.  Bigger values lead to better alignment but
       require large visible object parts. -->
  <param name="voxel_size" value="3.5"/>
  <!-- Voxel size is the size of the leafs of the octree, i.e., the "size" of
       the discretization. TRADEOFF: High values lead to less computation time
       but ignore object details, e.g., the method could not distinguish
       between a cylinder and an Amicelli box. Small values allow to better
       distinguish between objects, but will introduce more holes in the
       resulting "voxel-surface" (especially for a sparsely sampled scene) and
       thus will make normal computation unreliable. Processing time, of
       course, will increase with smaller voxel size. -->

  <param name="object_visibility" value="0.25"/>
  <!-- Object visibility is the expected visible object part expressed as
       fraction of the hole object. For example 'objectVisibility = 0.1' means
       that 10% of the object surface is visible in the scene. Note that the
       visibility can not be more than 0.5 since a typical camera can not see
       more than the half of the object. TRADEOFF: smaller values allow for a
       detection in occluded scenes but also lead to more false positives since
       object hypotheses with small alignment with the scene will be accepted.

  <param name="relative_object_size"                          value="0.05"/>
  <!-- Relative object size is the expected fraction of the scene points
       which belong to an object. For example a value of 0.05 means that each
       object represented in the scene will contain at least 5% of all scene
       points. TRADEOFF: lower values lead to more computation time and to
       higher success probability. -->
